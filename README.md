# HabiSave
HabiSave MVP is the minimal viable product of a goal-based savings tracker designed for young adults. This web app lets users create savings goals, log contributions manually or via bank API, and stay motivated with progress bars, badges, and milestone celebrations, all without the complexity of traditional budgeting tools.
